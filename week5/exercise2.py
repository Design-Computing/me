    # The Italian dinner

    In Douglas Hofstader's _Metamagical Themas_ (a compendium of essays he
    wrote for _Scientific American_ when he took over from martin Gardiner),
    there is a typically funny, but useful, introduction to production systems
    based on a recursive replacement algorithm to generate Italian recipes.
    Production systems are examples of recursive algorithms, that is, they are
    functions that use as input the output of their own results on earlier
    operations.

    The most general way of characterising a production system is to see it as
    a formal language based on symbol manipulation. They habe much in common
    with formal systems in logic in that:
        1.  they start with an axiom, which is given of the formal system;
        2.  there are a set of statements inthe formal system which can be
            thought of as theroums of the system; and
        3.  there are a set of rules for transforming any statement which is
            part of the formal system into any other using replacement rules.
    In the itallian dinner, teh axiom is of course _tomatoes_

    Note that in order for this to work, we need to have at least one word in
    the right-hand side that matches one of the words in the left-hand side.
    If we do not do this then the production system will not catch, and it will
    fail to expand into the florid ingredients list.

    From Paul Coates, Programming.Architecture
    I would strongly recommend reading this book!
